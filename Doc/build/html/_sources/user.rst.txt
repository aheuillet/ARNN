First and foremost, the server has to be launched before accessing this page. Open a terminal to the root location (*/Code/Django/recurView*) of the project and type **python3 manage.py runserver**. It may not work if migrations need be carried out, thus type **python3 manage.py makemigrations** then **python3 manage.py migrate** before. Once the server is running, a link towards the Web page (*http://127.0.0.1:8000/* by default) must be appear in your terminal. Click on the URL to access the homepage.
