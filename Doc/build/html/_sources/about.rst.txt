About ARNN
==========

Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks is a Web application belonging to the Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bordeaux. This was initially developed by a team of computer science engineering students from ENSEIRB-MATMECA in Talence, which is an engineering school of the French National Polytechnic Institute.

Here is the research center : `map`_.

This application allows a user to create a simulation of a recurrent neural network (Echo-State-Network) from a template, itself initialized with parameters chosen by him. Then, the user can train the tank of neurons or run the network on a previously uploaded corpus . A graphic interactive interface is available, which includes the representation of several metrics, such as the variation of the output matrix, in various forms. Some options are not mentioned here, though developed in the :ref:`User`.

The purpose of this project was to provide an application which may give some ideas to the scientists of the Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and help them in their researches.
