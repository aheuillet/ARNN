General Architecture
====================

The urls, views and forms are implemented in Python file associated in directory *ARNN*. The Html views can be found in directory *templates*.

Database
+++++++++
The chosen relational database management system is SQLite. It is set in *settings.py*.

The database includes the networks, the corpuses, the templates and the tasks the networks do. The tables can be seen in *models.py*. If data is needed to be added in the database, type **python3 manage.py makemigrations --empty ARNN** in directory *recurView*, the same one containing *manage.py*. Then, the create file in directory *migrations* should be edited to add data, take migration *0014* as an example.

The implementation of the project is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) management so that each implemented database table is associated to a file implementing the controller. For example, there are file *nework.py* and file *networkcontrol.py*.

Observables
+++++++++++

An "observable" is a network data we can see on the GUI manage by Bokeh. For instance, the user can observe the variation between the expected result and what the network gives as output. If an "observable" is needed to be added, then define a function in file *observables.py*.

An "observable" is displayed when it is added on the loaded network. It runs on the AJAX concept, as a consequence the graphs are dinamically plotted, see the :ref:`Links` for an explanation of the notion. Refer to the *make_ajax_plot* function in *bokeh.py* and file *index.html* concerning form *observable_form* in the script.

Futhermore, the data is persistent even if the server crashes thanks to the management of forms *observable_form* and *task_form* in the script of file *index.html* : *location.reload()* is called so that if the page is reloaded, it is carried out from the navigator cache.


Network managing
++++++++++++++++

A network is managed by *class NetworkRunner* found in *network.py*. The class corresponds to a layer containing the tank of neurons corresponding to *class ESN*. The caracteristics of the network are stored inside the database. If you want to see a complete description, go to :ref:`modindex` and select *ARNN.network* module.

First and foremost, *MackeyGlass* is provided by a reserved account whose *Username* is *admin*. All new created account get the *admin* corpera and its own. See *settings.py* and migration *0022*.

Thanks to this account, the task form shares *MackeyGlass* corpus, see *TaskForm* in *forms.py*.

.. image:: /image/sharedcorpus.png

The networks are saved from three different files. Each network saved-file name is in NPY format and begins with te number corresponding to the network primarey key in the database, followed by *Win*, *Wout* or *W* in regards to the data representing by the matrix.

Some different files can appear nonetheless with a ~ just after the primarey key, they are temporary files. Their use is concerning a crash of the server, or if the user does not choose the save option when the network tab is closed. If it happened, the user could choose which network version to load, the saved or temporary one.

If a new network option should be added, this could be done following some steps.
In the first place, you will need to stop the server in order to apply the update.
The first modification you will have to do in order to add your option is to go to the *\Django\recurView\ARNN* directory, where you have installed the web app. Open file *models.py*.

.. image:: /image/image_1.png

There, you will find the declaration of the class *Template*. In order to add a new option, add a new field to the class, it must be set equal to a Django model’s field. The field must correspond to the type of the parameter you want to add, for more information see the :ref:`Links`.

.. image:: /image/image_2.png

The verbose name is the name that is going to be displayed in the form on the website and is therefore not important.

.. image:: /image/image_3.png

You have to add a default value to your new field, chose it so that the behaviour of your networks will not change afterwise.

Now that the field have been added to the *Template* model, it is time to add this new parameter to the code. In order to do so, open file *network.py* to found *class NetworkRunner*.

.. image:: /image/image_4.png

In order for your new parameter to be considered, you will have to add a new parameter to the function *__init__*, with the exact same name and default than in *class Template*.

.. image:: /image/image_5.png

Then you can use your new parameter to do whatever you want, for exemple, changing the way the matrix of the *ESN* are generated. Below, a way to specify the leaking rate was added.
